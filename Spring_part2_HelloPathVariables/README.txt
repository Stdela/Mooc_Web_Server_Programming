In the previous task, we only had one page. However, it would be great if each hat had its own page - at least from the app userâ€™s perspective. 
The task template comes with an application that lists existing hats and shows them to the user. Each hat has a link that you should click to go to the hat's own page.

Implement a new single-hat html page ( single.html) in the task template and a method that redirects the request to the page.
As in the previous task, the method should listen for requests to paths of unpredictable form, and return the request to the user based on the path of the hat. 
Note! Unlike the previous task, in this task, the string used to identify the hat is created when the hat is created.
