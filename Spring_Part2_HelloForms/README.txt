he task template has functionality that allows information to be displayed on the page, and also allows information sent from the page to be processed. 
However, a form is required to submit the information to the page.

Execute src/main/resources/templatesthe index.htmlform in the file in the task folder . 
The form must have a text field with a name content. In addition to this, the form must also have a button with which the form can be submitted. 
The information on the form must be sent to the root address with a POST-type request.

When the application is working properly, you can use the form to change the title that appears on the page.
