Implement a new single-hat html page ( single.html) and a method that redirects the request to the page. 
As in the previous task, the method should listen for requests to paths of unpredictable form, and return the request to the user based on the path of the hat. 
In this task, the string used to identify the hat is created when the hat is created.
